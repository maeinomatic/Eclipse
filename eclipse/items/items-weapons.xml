			<p>You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls made with this magic weapon.</p>
			
			<p>The battleaxe holds up to 8 charges and regains 1d8 expended charges each day at dawn. As long as there is at least 1 charge remaining, attacks made with it deal an extra 1d8 fire damage to any target it hits, and the battleaxe regains 3 expended charges each time you roll a 20 on an attack roll with it. </p>
			
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Erupting Slash.</em></strong> As an action, you can expend 3 or more of the weapon's charges to slash the air in front you. 
			When you do, a line of flame 5 feet wide and 30 feet long erupts from the blade. 
			Each creature in the line must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take fire damage equal to 1d6 per charge spent. 
			If you expend all of the weapon's remaining charges in this way, the inferno deals an extra 3d6 fire damage and creatures take half damage on a successful save instead of none at all. 
			The DC for this saving throw is equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + the number of charges spent. Any flammable object caught in the blaze that isn't being worn or carried is ignited.</p>

		<description>
			<p>This elegant bow has 10 strings and can be used as a harp and spellcasting focus. You are proficient with harps while attuned to this weapon, and Charisma (Performance) checks made using the bow as a harp are made with advantage. You have a +2 bonus to damage rolls on ranged weapon attacks made with this magic weapon, and arrows fired from the bow deal thunder damage instead of piercing. In addition, the bow has 10 charges and regains I d6+4 charges each day at dawn. You can expend I to 5 of its charges as an action to cast either "thunderwave" or "magic missile" at a spell level equal to the number of charges you expend using your spellcasting modifier and spell save DC. </p>

			<p>This shortbow can cause a nonmagical nocked arrow to magically shatter and unleash a devastating spray of shrapnel. On your turn, you can use an action to force creatures within a 1 5 foot cone to make a DC 1 5 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, creatures within the cone take 2d6 magical piercing damage from the splintered shrapnel, or 3d6 if it was within 5 feet of you. This ability destroys the arrow used when creating the spray. </p>
