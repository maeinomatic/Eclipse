			<p>You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls made with this magic weapon.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Erupting Slash.</em></strong> As an action, you can expend 3 or more of the weapon's charges to slash the air in front you. 
			When you do, a line of flame 5 feet wide and 30 feet long erupts from the blade. 
			Each creature in the line must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take fire damage equal to 1d6 per charge spent. 
			If you expend all of the weapon's remaining charges in this way, the inferno deals an extra 3d6 fire damage and creatures take half damage on a successful save instead of none at all. 
			The DC for this saving throw is equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + the number of charges spent. Any flammable object caught in the blaze that isn't being worn or carried is ignited.</p>
