			<p>You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls made with this magic weapon.</p>
			
			<p>The greatsword holds up to 8 charges and regains 1d8 expended charges each day at dawn. </p>
			<p>As long as there is at least 1 charge remaining, attacks made with it deal an extra 1d8 fire damage to any target it hits. </p> 
			<p>The greatsword regains 3 expended charges each time you roll a 20 on an attack roll with it. </p>
			
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Erupting Slash.</em></strong> As an action, you can expend 3 or more of the weapon's charges to slash the air in front you. 
			When you do, a line of flame 5 feet wide and 30 feet long erupts from the blade. 
			Each creature in the line must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take fire damage equal to 1d6 per charge spent. 
			If you expend all of the weapon's remaining charges in this way, the inferno deals an extra 3d6 fire damage and creatures take half damage on a successful save instead of none at all. 
			The DC for this saving throw is equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + the number of charges spent. Any flammable object caught in the blaze that isn't being worn or carried is ignited.</p>

		<description>
			<p>This shortbow can cause a nonmagical nocked arrow to magically shatter and unleash a devastating spray of shrapnel. On your turn, you can use an action to force creatures within a 1 5 foot cone to make a DC 1 5 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, creatures within the cone take 2d6 magical piercing damage + your attack modifier from the splintered shrapnel, or 3d6 + your attack modifier if it was within 5 feet of you. This ability destroys the arrow used when creating the spray. </p>

		<description>	
			<p> This Saber is connected to the Archfey Veela. </p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Magically Light.</em></strong>This sword has been enchanted to feel lighter than it ought to be. At such it constitutes a light weapon with the finesse property. This weapons power can be used after taking a pact with Veela. The sword deals 1d8 slashing damage + your Charisma modifer on a successful atack. Damage dealt by the sword counts as magical damage. </p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Ranged Melee.</em></strong>The sword allows its wielder to slash distant enemies. Its cut is carried on a magical wind and can connect with an enemy that is too far away to be physically touched by the blade.  </p>
			<p>To use this property against a creature, make a ranged attack. Since the attack is magical, you may make the attack roll using either Dexterity or Stregth. The sword range is 60/100. The creature must be in a straight line from you. If any obstacle lies between you and the creature you are attacking, your attack instead impacts the obstacle. </p>
			<p> 1/day if you can smite, you can use your smite whe using Ranged Melee.  </p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Wind resistance.</em></strong>While you are attuned to the Wind Saber you are immune to wind-based effects, such as being pushed by the Gust of Wind spell. This effect doesn't make you immune to wind elemental damage.  </p>
