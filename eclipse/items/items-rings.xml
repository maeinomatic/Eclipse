  <element name="Magnetic Ring" type="Magic Item" source="eclipse" id="ID_ECL_MAGNETIC_RING">
		<description>
    			<p>This dense, roughly crafted metal ring seems to have an otherworldly pull on other metallic items. </p>
			<p>While wearing the ring, you can spend an hour holding onto an object weighing no more than 25 pounds that is made of at least 50% metal. If the ring and metallic item are in contact for the full hour, they form a powerful and magically controllable magnetic bond. You can only have one item bound to the ring in this way at a time. </p>
			<p>When the bound item is no more than 40 feet away from you and unobstructed, you can use your bonus action to magically pull it toward your outstretched hand at a speed of 20 feet per round. </p>
			<p>If another creature or object is partially obstructing the path your bound item will take, the item moves at half its regular speed until it moves past the obstruction, bouncing harmlessly against the obstruction until it's able to pass by. </p>

	 <element name="Signet Rings: Ring of Blindness" type="Magic Item" source="eclipse" id="ID_ECL_SIGNET_BLINDNESS">
		<description>
			<p>This Ring belongs to a set of 3</p>
			<p>Each of these three signets is decorated with the carving of a skull and a pair of skeletal hands that cover either its eyes (blindness), ears (deafness), or mouth (in an area of silence). Each ring has I charge, which it regains each day at dawn. If you are wearing the corresponding signet when you are blinded, deafened, or in an area of magical silence, you can expend I charge from the ring (no action required) to be cured of the condition or to speak a word or sentence (such as a verbal arcane components) that can be heard through the magical silence. Wearing the rings together as a set combines their collective charges: potentially allowing you to use one of the ring's properties multiple times. </p>
